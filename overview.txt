Project Aim
###########

The aim of this project is to create a 'package' of study to enable the taking and passing of the exam.

This package would ideally consist of:

	A series of presentations
	Teacher Notes
	Student Notes availible for handout etc.

Once complete a potential user should be able to grab the package and either use it to self-study, teach or adapt to their own needs.

As mentioned above the main presentations should be created in a powerpoint, sorry, format to allow the subject to be taught.

The Teacher notes should follow the current topic and provide a guide for the teacher to flesh out the slide a bit. This is important to get right as the teacher may not have
a lot of experience in the topic area.

The student notes should take the form of the keypoints from the topic allowing them to study and learn.
